# x5_stock_file_converter
> This is a little I use at my work to process file with x5 stock data.

Basicly it is a pandas script that does some actions with a file and creates a new one with the result. It is completely unflexible and will break as soon as file does not fit the example. However it may have as many days of data as long as they belong to one week.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

I think it may work on OS and Linux.

Windows:

To open the app on Windows either run gui.py via console or execute X5 week stock file converter X.X.X.exe

## Usage example

No need of any examples, as it is very simple app. Just follow the instructions on the screen.

## TODO
Here are my thoughts of what would be nice to add or fix:

* Catch errors
* Make it more flexible, so that it can convert files with many weeks

## Release History

* 1.0.0
    * First unflexible working version to temporary satisfy my needs
